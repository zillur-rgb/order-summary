## Overview
Here I got a jpeg file as I am a free subscriber so I did not get the design file. My task is to the Order Summary Card as close as the picture I am provided. It can be done by HTML and CSS. 

### The challenge
The challenge was to understand the padding and margin and slo the size of different elements. For that, as I am UI Designer already I started copying the design myself using Adobe XD and designed as close as possible. The I started coding. As I have just learned SASS(Syntactically Aswesome Stylesheet) which is a scripting language and preprocessor for CSS. I thought why not I try SASS. I did not need to use the complex SASS code but still as a newbie it was challenging.

Users should be able to:
- a Normal state where the design will be same.
- And also see hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS



### Continued development

In future I will continue using SASS and if possible I will try to implement my CSS Grid knowledge. And most importantly I will continue learning Javascript as I am only in basic stage currently.
